A very simple Task manager built with:

- Rails JSON API for the backend;
- AngularJS as the client js framework;
- CoffeeScript;
- Browserify to pack all the client code into a single bundle.js;
- Stylus for CSS;
- Gulp as a package builder / task runner;
- RSpec for testing server side code;
- Karma, Mocha, Chai, Sinon for client code testing.
